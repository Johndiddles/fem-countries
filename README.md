## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux


### What I learned

I learnt how to integrate redux into my react app as I really needed it for my state management especially with returning the full name of the border countries since the country's api returns an alpha3code for the border countries instead of the border country's full name

### Continued development
At the moment, I really want to focus on my state management as it is an important part of using ReactJS and has really been a trouble. If anyone ever gets to read this, I'd appreaciate any material or tutorial to overcome this hurdle
